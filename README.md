## ✨ What is ShadowByte?

**ShadowByte** is a fork of Shinrai - https://github.com/Manifestors-Open-Source/Shinrai - which is a sleek and powerful utility mod for **Minecraft 1.21.7**, developed using the **Fabric Mod Loader**.  
Our goal is simple: **make things easier, faster, and more enjoyable**, while maintaining performance and clarity.

## 🔴 Features

ShadowByte offers the same features as Shinrai - https://github.com/Manifestors-Open-Source/Shinrai - plus some additions made my yours truly

## ❓ Why "cheating"?

**Short answer:** Because it's fun.  
Shinrai is about testing limits, enjoying creative chaos, and doing so with style.
